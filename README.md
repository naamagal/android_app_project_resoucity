# ResourCity - Android App
Final Project, as part of a Course on Android-Apps, HUJI

## What is ResourCity?
ResourCity is an urban resource collecting App, based on location and time through social sharing.
In cities there are many resources that we are not aware of and are not properly utilized. The purpose of the App is to enable us to 'read the city' in a different point view, creatively.
Look about the resources that are around us all the time, and the things we can produce from them.
The goal is to let our users to be part of the creation, and not only users of constant values we forced them to.
We want them to be more active, aware to the surroundings: to be able to share, add opinions and ideas, and TO BE CREATIVE!
